# Thought-Tracker
This shell script is intended to be used with a cronjob.

It takes an email address as an argument and displays a popup menu which asks the user want they are thinking about.

Then, it passes their response to a python script where it is saved in a sqlite database.

## Inspiration for this project

I thought it would be cool to track what I think about on a regular basis so I decided to make a little application for it!

I really enjoyed the python scripting. That language makes me feel like a wizard!
